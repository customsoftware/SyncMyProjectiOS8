MySQL Server Hostname (DSN): wxdata.db
MySQL Admin Username: customsoftwa
MySQL Admin Password: <Your member password>

Your MySQL admin username has full privileges to manage this 
process. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:

1) You MUST use your DSN when connecting to your MySQL process from PHP
and CGI scripts.  If you use 'localhost' or do not specify a DSN, you 
will get an error message.

2) Change the MySQL admin password at your first opportunity to 
be different from your member password.

3) DO NOT use your MySQL admin username and password in PHP
or CGI scripts.  Create additional usernames for your day-to-day 
operations and leave your MySQL admin username as a backup in 
case you accidentally lock yourself out of your process.  If 
we have to reset your MySQL admin username permissions, you may lose 
some or all of your data.

4) NEVER remove the "mysql" database from your MySQL process.  Doing so
will destroy your MySQL process and we are unlikely to be able to help you
recover it.

5) By default, your MySQL process contains no databases.  You will
need to create one via our member interface or as part of the
setup process of an application you are installing.
